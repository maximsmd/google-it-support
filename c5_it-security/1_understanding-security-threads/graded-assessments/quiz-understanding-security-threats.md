### Question 1

A network-based attack where one attacking machine overwhelms a target with traffic is a(n) _______ attack.

* Injection
* Malware
* **Denial of Service**
* Brute force password 

> This is a classic denial-of-service attack. Note that this is not a distributed denial-of-service attack, as the attack traffic is coming from a single source and not distributed over many attacking hosts

<br>

### Question 2

When cleaning up a system after a compromise, you should look closely for any ______ that may have been installed by the attacker.

* Poisoned DNS caches
* **Backdoors**
* Rogue APs
* Injection attacks 

<br>

### Question 3

A(n) _____ attack is meant to prevent legitimate traffic from reaching a service.

* **Denial of Service**
* Injection
* Password
* DNS Cache poisoning

<br>

### Question 4

The best defense against password attacks is using strong _______.

* **Passwords**
* Encryption
* Firewall configs
* Antimalware software 

> Strong passwords will make password attacks too time-consuming to be viable for an attacker.

<br>

### Question 5

Which of these is an example of the confidentiality principle that can help keep your data hidden from unwanted eyes?

* **Protecting online accounts with password protection**
* Making sure the data hasn't been tampered with
* Preventing data loss
* Preventing an unwanted download 

> Password protection can help limit access to your data so that only those who need it can see it.

<br>

### Question 6

What could potentially decrease the availability of security and also test the preparedness of data loss?

* Adware
* Keylogger
* Spyware
* **Ransomware**

> Ransomware could prevent access to your data by holding the data hostage until you pay a ransom.

<br>

### Question 7

Which of these is a characteristic of Trojan malware?

* A Trojan is basically backdoor malware.
* A Trojan may get installed without the user’s consent.
* A Trojan is the same thing as a rootkit.
* **A Trojan infection needs to be installed by the user.**

> Just like how the historical Trojan horse was accepted into the city by the citizens of Troy, a malicious Trojan disguised in a trusted program has to be accepted and executed by the user.

<br>

### Question 8

What is it called when a hacker is able to get into a system through a secret entryway in order to maintain remote access to the computer?

* **A backdoor**
* Ransomware
* A Trojan
* Adware 

> A backdoor is a way for a hacker to get into a system through a secret entryway.

<br>

### Question 9

An unhappy Systems Administrator wrote a malware program to bring down the company's services after a certain event occurred. What type of malware does this describe?

* **A logic bomb**
* A rootkit
* Ransomware
* Spyware 

> A logic bomb is malware that is intentionally triggered by a hacker once a certain event or time has occurred.

<br>

### Question 10

Which of these is where a victim connects to a network that the victim thinks is legitimate, but is really an identical network controlled by a hacker to monitor traffic?

* A Denial of Service (DoS)
* **Evil Twin**
* A logic bomb
* DNS Cache Poisoning 

> The premise of an Evil Twin is for the victim to connect to a network that is identical to a legit one, but it is actually controlled by a hacker.

<br>

### Question 11

How can injection attacks be prevented? Check all that apply.

* **Data sanitization**
* Flood guards
* Log analysis systems
* **Input validation**

> Injection attacks can be mitigated with good software development principles such as validating input. 

<br>

### Question 12

If a hacker targets a vulnerable website by running commands that delete the website's data in its database, what type of attack did the hacker perform?

* A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack
* A dictionary attack
* Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
* **SQL injection** 

> A SQL injection targets an entire website if the site uses a SQL database. If vulnerable, hackers can run SQL commands that allow them to delete web data, copy it, and run other malicious commands.

<br>

### Question 13

An attacker, acting as a postal worker, used social engineering tactics to trick an employee into thinking she was legitimately delivering packages. The attacker was then able to gain physical access to a restricted area by following behind the employee into the building. What type of attack did the attacker perform? Check all that apply.

* Tailgating
* Phishing
* Spoofing
* **Social engineering**

> Social engineering is an attack method that relies heavily on interactions with humans. Humans will always be the weakest link in a security system.

###Question 14
Fill in the blank: Phishing, spoofing and tailgating are examples of _____ attacks

* Injection
* **Social engineering**
* Network
* Walware

> Phishing, spoofing, and tailgating are examples of social engineering attacks. These types of attacks manipulate human behavior to gain unauthorized access or sensitive information.

###Question 15
In the CIA triad, what does the letter I stand for

* Implementation
* **Intergrity**
* Information
* Intelligence

> The three letters in "CIA triad" stand for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

###Question 16
What kind of malware can block access to data and decrease the availability of security by holding the system hostage

* Spyware
* A logic bomb
* Adware
* **Rasomware**

> A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.

###Question 17
Which of the following is an example of a zero-day vulnerability?   

* **A group of hackers finds a flaw in a new software product and takes advantage of it before the vendor or developer finds it.**
* After a user downloads and starts a piece of software, it starts showing ads and collecting data.
* A user voluntarily downloads a piece of software hoping it will be useful, but instead it lets hackers access the user’s computer.
* A user accidentally loads malware onto a computer that logs the user’s keypresses and uses them to get confidential information.

> A zero-day vulnerability refers to a software flaw that is exploited by attackers before the vendor or developer is aware of it and has had a chance to fix it.

###Question 18
Which of the following attacks send many packets to a system to crash it or to prevent services from being available? Select all that apply.

* **A ping of death (POD) attack**
* **Ping flood**
*An evil twin attack
* **SYN flood**

> These attacks are aimed at overwhelming a system with packets to cause it to crash or become unavailable, disrupting normal services.

###Question 18
Which of the following best helps you strengthen your password?

* Choose the name of a favorite movie as a password
* Use the name of a beloved pet as a password
* **Incorporate symbols, numbers, and capital letters**
